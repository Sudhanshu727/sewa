/**
 * Resolves and validates a team's category + option-type choice into the
 * three server-derived fields the Team row actually stores. This is the one
 * place that turns "problemCategoryCode + problemOptionType [+ proposed
 * text]" into a trustworthy problemStatementId / theme / problemStatement -
 * every caller (create, update) must go through this rather than deriving
 * these fields itself, so the rules can't drift between the two call sites.
 *
 * Must be called inside the same $transaction as the Team write when
 * optionType is "open": assigning the sequence number and creating the row
 * that uses it need to succeed or fail together, or a failed team creation
 * would burn a sequence number for nothing (harmless - gaps are fine - but
 * avoidable) and, worse, a retried request could reuse a number if the
 * assignment succeeded outside the transaction but the write didn't.

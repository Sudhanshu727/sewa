 * Problem-statement category catalogue.

 *
 * IMPORTANT: this must be kept in sync by hand with the frontend's own copy
 * of this list (frontend/src/components/ProblemStatementsPage.tsx —
 * NATIONAL_CATEGORY_LIST and COMMUNITY_CATEGORY_LIST). It is intentionally
 * NOT a database table: the categories are a small, static, per-season list
 * that changes at most once between challenge cycles, not per-request data.
 * If that stops being true - categories become admin-editable, change
 * mid-season, or need to be queried/reported on independently - promote
 * this to a real seeded table instead of hand-syncing two files.
